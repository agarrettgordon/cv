        <p>I am a professional career jumper. Many years ago, I ventured into the world of web development as a hobby and enjoyed it a great deal and went on to receive a certificate from the University of Washington. But, lack of confidence and not knowing where to use the skills learned or how to add to those skills, led me to give up and head back into the mediocre world of clerical/administrative services.</p>
